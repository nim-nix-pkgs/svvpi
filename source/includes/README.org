The ~.h~ files in this directory and in the ~orig/~ directory are
functionally the same.

The only change is that comments spanning multiple lines are collapsed
to a single line, otherwise the ~nimterop.cImport~ doesn't
work.

Here's an example:

This in ~sv_vpi_user.h~:

#+begin_src C
#define cbReclaimObj          701 /* callback on class object reclaimed by
                                     automatic memory management */
#+end_src

is converted to:

#+begin_src C
#define cbReclaimObj          701 /* callback on class object reclaimed by automatic memory management */
#+end_src
